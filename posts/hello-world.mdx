Welcome to Blankpage — a minimal blog built from scratch.

## Why another blog?

Sometimes you just want a blank page and a place to think out loud. No analytics, no comments, no clutter. Just words on a page.

## What's under the hood

This site is statically generated with Next.js and styled with Linaria. Posts are written in MDX, which means you can mix Markdown with JSX components when you need to.

The whole thing compiles down to plain HTML, CSS, and JS — no server required.

## What's next

More writing, hopefully. Stay tuned.
